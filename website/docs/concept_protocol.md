The web-ring protocol defines a standard `web-ring.json` file hosted at the root of your site
that contains information about the web ring itself, and more importantly which sites are
previous and next in the web ring.

The [widget](concept_widget.md) uses this information to render a bar at the bottom of your site
containing links to the previous and next site.
